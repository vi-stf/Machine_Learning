# Machine_Learning: Prediction of Customers Online intention.


In this analysis, an Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention data set is used provided by UC Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository. The primary purpose of the analysis is to predict whether a customer will purchase from the store’s website.


# Attribute Information:

The dataset consists of 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes. The 'Revenue' attribute is used as the class label and the target variable. The data set contains 12,330 sessions, where 84.5% (10,422) are negative class (did not end purchasing), and the rest 15.5% (1908) are positive class (end with purchasing).

"Administrative", "Administrative Duration", "Informational", "Informational Duration", "Product Related" and "Product Related Duration" represent the number of different types of pages visited by the visitor in that session and total time spent in each of these page categories. The values of these features are derived from the URL information of the pages visited by the user.  

The "Bounce Rate" feature shows the percentage of customers who enter the site from that page and then leave ("bounce") without triggering any other requests. The "Exit Rate" of the web page shows the percentage that is the last in the session for all pages. The "Page Value" of a web page represents the average value that a customer visits before completing a transaction. The three features are metrics measured by "Google Analytics" for each page of the e-shop.

The "Special Day" feature indicates the closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day (e.g. Valentine's Day) in which the sessions are more likely to end up with a purchase.

The dataset also contains features like "operating system", "browser", "region", "traffic type", "visitor type".
